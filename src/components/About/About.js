I am an electrical and electronics engineer and at the same time an aspiring full stack web developer. For a long time, i have been very interested in web technologies. Now that I can work very closely and play with these technologies gives me a lot of happiness. Currently I am learing the react library. I am eagerly waiting to learn many other technologies. I am willing to give my heart and soul in learning so that in near future I can call myself an successful web developer and make my close ones proud.</p>
